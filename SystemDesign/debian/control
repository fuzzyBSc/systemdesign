Description: SystemDesign
 A simple modelling tool for INCOSE-style systems engineering. That is,
 a tool for breaking down units of work across multiple teams within a large
 engineering organisation rather than being a network engineering tool.
 This tool is intended to demonstrate basic systems engineering techniques
 suitable for orchestrating the design of large systems involving multiple
 teams.
